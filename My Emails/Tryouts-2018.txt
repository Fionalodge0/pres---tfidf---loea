Central Players and Parents,

You have until this Friday to turn your forms into Ms. Funk in order to participate on the first day of tryouts.  If you haven't done this, do it tomorrow!  Remember, if we get 33 girls within the first two days of tryouts, we will celebrate with a pizza party.  
    
Tryout Schedule:  Tryouts start on March 12th at Jimmy Lee.  Please check the following times and come to the correct group:  Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Pitchers and catchers still come to the 'All' time groups.

2:30-4:00 returning C team and newcomers to Central Softball
4:00-5:30 returning JV and V

Game Schedule:  You can check the game schedule here, and I suggest that you check for conflicts, especially during spring break.  Let me know if you have any concerns or questions.  
Central Softball Updated Schedule

Open Gyms:  There are three open gyms left, this Tuesday-Thursday, 2:30-4:30 at Jimmy Lee.  If you haven't been and can go, do it!   It is good to get to know your teammates before the season starts.

Help me out:  I don't think I got everyone's email at the pre-season meeting, so please ask your friends if they are getting my emails.  If they are not, please have them email me.  If you also would like to add a different email (or your phone) to the list, let me know.  

See you soon!  Please ask if you have any questions!
